async def process_users(users: List[User]) -> None:
    """Process a list of users asynchronously."""
    tasks = [user.greet() for user in users]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    users = [

Complex equations with matrices:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
